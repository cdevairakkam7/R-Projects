* A website like Amazon has thousands of pages and if a data scientist wants to know which web pages drive the most traffic and what products are hosted in those webpages? This R [code](https://github.com/cdevairakkam7/R-Projects/blob/master/Top%2010%20Web%20Pages%20Visited%20In%20A%20Website.R) will help in solving the problem. 

* Next step of the funnel is to track events in these pages.  In order to find the top 5 events in the top 10 pages use this  [code](https://github.com/cdevairakkam7/R-Projects/blob/master/Top%205%20events.R).

* Have you ever wondered when you buy something online you get recommendations automatically. This is called market basket analysis and can be achieved using [Apriori](https://github.com/cdevairakkam7/R-Projects/blob/master/Apriori.R) algorithm

* The world has moved to a subscription-based economy. This means the churn rate of a product needs to be as low as possible in order to maintain the revenue of the company. Even before Netflix, telecom companies mastered the art of subscription. Let us analyze a telecom provider's dataset using R and see if we can derive conclusions. This problem needs [explanation](https://github.com/cdevairakkam7/R-Projects/blob/master/Subscription%20Churn%20Analysis.pdf) of the solution to support the actual R [code](https://github.com/cdevairakkam7/R-Projects/blob/master/Churn%20Analysis.R).

* Apart from classifying flowers the second most popular lightweight dataset that is put to test is titanic survival analysis dataset. The code and explanation can be found [here](https://github.com/cdevairakkam7/R-Projects/blob/master/Titanic.pdf).
